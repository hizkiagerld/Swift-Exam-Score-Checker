This code functions as an Exam Score Checker that consists of 4 subjects (English, History, Science, Social). It lets the user know if they passed or failed the exam by checking their score on the terminal. The code runs using the `swift run` command.

**How it works:**
The minimum passing score is set to 70.
1. The user must first enter their full name (must consist of letters, not numbers).
2. The user then chooses a subject by selecting the corresponding number (1-4).
3. Finally, the user submits their score to see the result.

Note: If the user enters a score higher than 100, it will be considered invalid, and the program will ask them to submit a valid score again.
